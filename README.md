### Update 13 March ###

I have created the Github Classroom organization - waiting for the approval for educational access & you will be invited immediately (additional information will be provided via email)

<br>

**Deadline**: by Lab W4 ( 20.03.2017 ) you need to **complete the documentation (5 docs) for the project and the Analysis & Design document for Assigment 1**. 

Please also read Chapter 5 from [the Microsoft Application Architecture Guide v2](https://www.fizyka.umk.pl/~jacek/docs/net/Application_Architecture_Guide_v2.pdf). If interested, you can read Chapters 6-9 for more in-depth best practices related to the Layers architectural style and Chapters 1-4 for general better understanding of Software Architecture & development.

<br>

Next Lab we will work together on setting up Github

Please read [this Github starter](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) for learning about using git.
