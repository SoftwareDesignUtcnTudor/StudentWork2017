### Update 13 March ###

I have created the Github Classroom organization - waiting for the approval for educational access & you will be invited immediately (additional information will be provided via email)

Please read [this Github starter](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) for learning about using git.

Please read [this Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) (the format for writing this README)

*Deadline*: by Lab W4 ( 20.03.2017 ) you need to _complete the documentation (5 docs) for the project_ and the Analysis & Design document for Assigment 1. Please also read Chapter 5 from [the Microsoft Application Architecture Guide v2](https://www.fizyka.umk.pl/~jacek/docs/net/Application_Architecture_Guide_v2.pdf). If interested, you can read Chapters 6-9 for more in-depth best practices related to the Layers architectural style and Chapters 1-4 for general better understanding of Software Architecture & development.
